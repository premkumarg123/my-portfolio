            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a Masters student in Data Science at the University at Buffalo, set to graduate in December 2025. This is my first semester, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the field of data science. Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at KreditBee, where I gained significant industry experience. I applied the knowledge and skills I learned during college and expanded my understanding of the professional field. This hands-on experience has been invaluable in shaping my career aspirations.</p>

                <h3>Detecting Fraud Transaction using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
                <p>UB | Spring 2024</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a hybrid model combining Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and neural networks to enhance fraud detection by leveraging the strengths of each method.</li>
                    <li>Utilized advanced anomaly detection algorithms, including Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM, to accurately identify transactions that deviate from established patterns and raise flags for potential fraud.</li>
                    <li>Achieved the highest accuracy of 94.84% with the Isolation Forest model, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between normal and anomalous behaviors in financial transactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Task Failure Prediction in Cloud Data Centers Using Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>VIT Vellore | Fall 2022</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) multi-level failure prediction model for cloud data centers to enhance service reliability and availability.</li>
                    <li>Achieved a prediction accuracy of 93% for task failures and 87% for job failures, with an F1 score of 92% and 86%, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art prediction algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated the model's effectiveness using metrics such as receiver operating characteristic, time-increase cost, and accuracy, showing that it can significantly improve proactive failure management without additional time cost compared to RNN and LSTM.</li>
